# hello-world
my first repository


Hello, my name is Neil. I started learning to code in an effort to start a business. I am working through the FreeCodeCamp.com courses and have started some projects to help me learn in addition to those courses. Since starting to code I have met other like minded people through FreeCodeCampand we have started moving forward with a major project. I am a little over my head, but I am diving in!
